# AFtheM
API Fortress - The Mediator

AFtheM is an Open Source, Scala / Akka based, asynchronous API Micro-Gateway.

The purpose of this project is to provide a highly modular gateway to help developers, QAs and data scientists to:

* Capture
* Measure
* Transform
* Filter
* Simulate

API Calls.

The processing engine can also be fine tuned to the extreme to have it perform the way you need.
